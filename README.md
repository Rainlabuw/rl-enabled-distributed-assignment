## Implementation of RL-Enabled Distributed Assignment (REDA)
This repository contains a streamlined implementation of RL-Enabled Distributed Assignment (REDA), the algorithm described to solve sequential assignment problems in 'Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning for Sequential Satellite Assignment Problems'.

The code in this repository was based on the [EPyMARL framework](https://github.com/uoe-agents/epymarl), but has been modified to better fit REDA and the associated experiments.

## Installation
The Python environment parameters are listed in requirements.txt

**This works best with Python 3.8.12**, ideally installed in a conda environment.

Thus, the recommended steps are:
 - `conda create -n "myenv" python=3.8.12 ipython`
 - `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`
 - (Maybe necessary to get shapely to work) `conda install geos`
